# TF-IDF Explanation

TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) transforms text into numeric vectors.
We apply TF-IDF to the 'Genre' column to produce vectors representing genres for each anime.
Cosine similarity is then used on those vectors to compute similarity between anime.
This enables content-based recommendations.
